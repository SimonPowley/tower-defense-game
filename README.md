# Tower Defense Game
A tower defense game inspired by Bloons Tower Defense, built with JavaScript

# Intro/Background
Started as a Python project using pygame, but I decided to remake/continue with JavaScript because I wanted to learn how to use it.
I tried to take the things I learned from the first project I did (Pokemon inspired game) and the original Python version of this game
in order to keep the code/functions a little more organized/easier to read and maintain (hopefully).
Graphics are pretty simple (basically shapes and text) because I don't have very much css knowledge yet.

# Gameplay
Basic gameplay:
* Choose a map to play on (2 options for now)
* Buy and place towers from the shop to prevent enemies from reaching the end of the path
* Different towers have different abilities and upgrade paths
* Money is awarded for defeating enemies and completing rounds
* Rounds progressively get harder and enemies get faster/stronger
* The game ends when the last round (40 for now) is beaten, or the player loses all of their lives
