# Tower Defense Game
A tower defense game inspired by Bloons Tower Defense, built with JavaScript

# Intro/Background
Started as a Python project using pygame, but I decided to remake/continue with JavaScript because I wanted to learn how to use it.
I tried to take the things I learned from the first project I did (Pokemon inspired game) and the original Python version of this game
in order to keep the code/functions a little more organized/easier to read and maintain (hopefully).
Graphics are pretty simple (basically shapes and text) because I don't have very much css/graphics knowledge yet.

# Gameplay
Basic gameplay:
* Choose a map to play on (2 options for now)
* Buy and place towers from the shop to prevent enemies from reaching the end of the path
* Different towers have different abilities and upgrade paths
* Money is awarded for defeating enemies and completing rounds
* Rounds progressively get harder and enemies get faster/stronger
* The game ends when the last round (40 for now) is beaten, or the player loses all of their lives

# Towers
Towers have different stats including:
* Cost- how much a tower costs in the tower shop
* Power- amount of damage dealt to enemies
* Pierce- number of enemies tower can hit with a single projectile
* Range- distance towers can see and hit enemies from
* Speed- how often a tower can shoot (does not affect movement speed of projectile itself, probably should though)
* Projectile limit- number of projectiles a tower can have active at once
* Projectile type/effect- 
  * Bullet (normal projectile, nothing special)
  * Bomb (explodes once pierce limit is reached, damaging surrounding enemies)
  * Poison (applies poison effect to enemies, damaging them over time)
  * Slow (applies slow effect to enemies, slowing their movement speed)
  * Ring (a ring/shockwave that expands out from the tower, damaging enemies in range)
  * Laser (currently the same as the normal bullet, but red)
  * Reverse (applies reverse effect to enemies, causing them to briefly move backwards along the path)
  * Stun (applies stun effect to enemies, pausing their movement for a short time)
  * Mine (gold/money generated by mine tower)

There are currently seven different tower types:
* Basic Tower ($200)-
    * average tower
    * upgrade path 1 focuses on speed and pierce
    * upgrade path 2 focuses on power and range
* Turret Tower ($300)-
    * shoots in multiple directions at once
    * upgrade path 1 focuses on pierce and gains "ring" projectile type
    * upgrade path 2 focuses on power and gains "laser" projectile type
* Bomb Tower ($500)-
    * shoots bombs that can explode and hit multiple enemies
    * upgrade path 1 focuses on power, increased projectile size, and blast size
    * upgrade path 2 focuses on speed, pierce, and range (supposed to act more like a missile than a bomb)
 * Chem Tower ($650)-
    * applies different effects to enemies
    * upgrade path 1 focuses on poisoning enemies
    * upgrade path 2 focuses on slowing enemies down
 * Ninja Tower ($1200)-
    * well-rounded tower, can apply different effects to enemies based on upgrade path
    * upgrade path 1 focuses on range and gains "reverse" projectile effect
    * upgrade path 2 focuses on speed and gains "stun bomb" projectile ("stun" effect + "bomb" type)
  * Laser Tower ($2000)-
     * shoots over a long range and can peirce many enemies
     * upgrade path 1 focuses on speed and increasing projectile limit
     * upgrade path 2 focuses on pierce and increasing projectile size
   * Mine Tower ($1500)-
     * generates gold during each round that can be collected manually or automatically at the end of the round
     * upgrade path 1 focuses on increasing the speed gold is generated at
     * upgrade path 2 focuses on increasing the amount of gold that can be stored before filling up
